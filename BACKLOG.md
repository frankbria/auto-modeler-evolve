# Evolution Backlog

Living document for coordinating between bot instances and tracking ideation.
**Read this before starting work. Write your focus before implementing.**

## Currently Working On

## Day 3 (00:09) — Coverage + Time-Series Decomposition
Gap analysis and coverage hardening: tests for radar chart (chart_builder 73%→100%),
orchestrator edge paths (78%→95%), and chat API (37%→75% via Anthropic mock). Error
resilience: model training failure + terrible model paths. Track B: time-series
decomposition chart (detect date columns, compute moving average + trend, new endpoint
/api/data/{id}/timeseries, frontend line chart renderer already handles multi-series).




## Ideas to Explore

Ideas discovered during sessions. Pick from here or add new ones.

- Full E2E test suite covering upload → explore → train → deploy → predict flow
- Gap analysis: verify every [x] spec item actually works end-to-end
- Integration with XGBoost / LightGBM for better model recommendations
- prompts.py and narration.py modules for richer chat experience
- Self-demo script that exercises the full platform and captures output
- Excel / Google Sheets upload support
- Template projects for common use cases (sales forecast, churn prediction)
- Interactive correlation heatmap visualization
- Multi-dataset join/merge through conversation

<!-- - [Description] — Day N (HH:MM) — [1-line outcome] -->

- E2E test suite build-out (upload/training/deploy) — Day 2 (10:00) — 33 Playwright tests; fixed 2 UX bugs (dataset restore + ModelTrainingPanel runs restore); 33/33 pass
- Smarter chat orchestration (prompts.py + narration.py) — Day 2 (16:08) — auto-inject upload/training messages into chat; 44 tests; 255 total pass
- Error resilience audit + query engine tests + correlation heatmap — Day 2 (20:05) — 72 new tests; 2 real bugs fixed (NaN/inf in preview); query_engine 14%→92%; total coverage 95%; heatmap chart type + endpoint
- Integration tests + radar chart — Day 2 (14:00) — 11 integration tests (upload→deploy→predict); radar chart for model comparison with normalized metrics; 338 total backend tests pass
